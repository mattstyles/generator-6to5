> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for scaffolding [6to5](http://6to5.org/) built client-side apps.

If [Slush](http://slushjs.github.io/) is more your thing then consider checking out the slightly more involved [slush-es2015](https://github.com/mattstyles/slush-es2015).

## Tech List

* Less
* Browserify
* 6to5
* Built with Gulp

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-6to5
mkdir awesome-app && cd $_
yo 6to5
```

This generator is pretty skinny on functionality but itâ€™ll scaffold you out a good and clean starting point for exploring 6to5.
